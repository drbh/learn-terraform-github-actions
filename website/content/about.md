### Organizational Experience

Most of my professional experience has been with my Alma Mater; Arizona State University. I started working at ASU during my undergrad, graduate and continued as I moved back to New York from Arizona. I've been a 100% remote employee since about 2016. 

Outside of my position at ASU, I've worked many freelance jobs from Rust dev paid in BTC by devs I've never met, to Squarespace customizations for local businesses. 

Below are my most recent W-2 jobs:

Year | Organization | Things I did
-----|-------|--------
2015 - 2020 | Arizona State University  | Wearer of many hats
2019 | Campuswire | Fullstack React, backend websocket Golang dev
2015 | Citrix | Outbound sales, cold calling, warm leads

### Academic Experience

There are many many smaller "academic" experiences that are not listed here. These include but are not limited to free online course from institutions like [Stanford Online](https://prod-cert-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/c3380091a39d4292bd260e0174f2f727/Statement.pdf) and [EdX + MIT](https://s3.amazonaws.com/verify.edx.org/downloads/c8c870c6803e433ca79b009a47901cf7/Certificate.pdf).  

Shout out to all the YouTube videos, Defcon conferences and hackers in there basements who shared thier deep and wide knowledge. Those resouces have been invaluable in continuing my education.
